## Movie Genre Prediction from Audio, Visual, and Text Features
In this project was developed a Neural Network for genre movie prediction. Some Feature Engineering tasks were done for this purpose.

### Files
- The Neural Network is available in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/movie-genre-prediction/blob/master/Neural%20Network%20for%20movie%20genre%20prediction.ipynb).
- A research report is available [here](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/movie-genre-prediction/blob/master/Research%20Report.pdf).

### Requirements
- Environment for run a Jupyter Notebook. For example: [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/install). A basic requirement for Jupyter Notebook is Python.   
- The data files utilized in this project should be in a folder named 'data' in the same directory that the file 'Neural Network for movie genre prediction.ipynb'.


### Compatibility
The libraries needed in this project are specified in the Jupyter Notebook. The most general libraries utilized are:
- Python: 3.7.5
- Tensorflow: 2.0.0
- Keras: 2.2.4-tf

### Context
This works is part of the subject COMP90049 Introduction to Machine Learning, 2020 Semester 1, The University of Melbourne.
